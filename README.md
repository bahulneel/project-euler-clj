# project-euler-clj
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bahulneel/project-euler-clj.png)](http://travis-ci.org/bahulneel/project-euler-clj)

This is my attempt to solve the [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) problems
using both [clojure](http://clojure.github.com) and sequence programming 

## Testing

running:
    lein test

will test all of the solved problems so they can be easily refactored later
